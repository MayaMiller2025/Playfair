# Mathematical Analysis

*The key is a 5Ã—5 grid of alphabets that acts as the key for encrypting of the plaintext. (Plaintext is text that is not computationally tagged, specially formatted, or written in code). Each of the 25 alphabets must be different and one letter of the alphabet (usually is J) is removed from the table (because the table can only hold 25 letters... do the math). If the text contains J, then it is replaced by I.*


# Computer Code

*How difficult would it be to decode PlayFair?*

The general method of breaking the Playfair cipher is about performing frequency analysis of pairs of letters. Knowing estimated frequencies for a language that was used in the message, one can try to match frequent ciphertext pairs to frequent pairs of letters in the language.  The ammount of time is unknown for how long it would take to decode though.  It seems fairly complicated at first but once you get the patterns down it doesnt seem too bad.
