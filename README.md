# Historical Context
The playfair cypher was the first cypher to encrypt pairs of letters in cryptologic history. It was created by Sir Charles Wheatstone but it carries the name of his friend, Lyon Playfair, who promoted its use. The cypher was created for secrecy in messages sent back and forth. The first known description of the playfair cypher was signed by Wheatstone in 1854.

# Mechanics 

This cipher uses a block of two letters to encypt messages and then uses a keyword to arrange the alaphbet. Most of the times J is removed and the letter I takes its place. [Playfair] https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/playfair-cipher
