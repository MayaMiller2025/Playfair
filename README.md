# Mathematical Analysis

*The key is a 5Ã—5 grid of alphabets that acts as the key for encrypting of the plaintext. (text that is not computationally tagged, specially formatted, or written in code). Each of the 25 alphabets must be different and one letter of the alphabet (usually is J) is removed from the table (because the table can only hold 25 letters... do the math). If the text contains J, then it is replaced by I.*
