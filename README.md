# Historical Context
The playfair cypher was the first cypher to encrypt pairs of letters in cryptologic history. It was created by Sir Charles Wheatstone but it carries the name of his friend, Lyon Playfair, who promoted its use. The cypher was created for secrecy in messages sent back and forth. The first known description of the playfair cypher was signed by Wheatstone in 1854.

# Mechanics 

This cipher uses a block of two letters to encypt messages and then uses a keyword to arrange the alaphbet. Most of the times J is removed and the letter I takes its place. [Playfair] https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/playfair-cipher

# Mathematical Analysis

*The key is a 5Ã—5 grid of alphabets that acts as the key for encrypting of the plaintext. (Plaintext is text that is not computationally tagged, specially formatted, or written in code). Each of the 25 letters must be different and one letter of the alphabet (usually is J) is removed from the table (because the table can only hold 25 letters... do the math). If the text contains J, then it is replaced by I.*


# Computer Code

*How difficult would it be to decode PlayFair?*

The general method of breaking the Playfair cipher is about performing frequency analysis of pairs of letters. Knowing estimated frequencies for a language that was used in the message, one can try to match frequent ciphertext pairs to frequent pairs of letters in the language.  The ammount of time is unknown for how long it would take to decode though.  It seems fairly complicated at first but once you get the patterns down it doesnt seem too bad.

# Final Analysis
This code was very useful because it made breaking messages so much harder. The first published solution of the cypher was in a 19-page pamphlet, in 1914. The cypher is no longer used today because the modern technology of today is able to decipher it in miliseconds.
